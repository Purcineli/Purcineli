## 🚀 About Me

I'm a developer from **Ribeirão Preto, Brazil** 🇧🇷, passionate about building solutions that solve real-world problems. My expertise spans **full-stack web development** with Django, **mobile applications**, and **intelligent automation** that eliminates repetitive tasks in corporate environments.

**What drives me?** Turning hours of manual work into seconds of automated execution while ensuring compliance, accuracy, and reliability.

I'm an enthusiastic adopter of **AI-powered development tools** — working daily with Claude, Cursor, and other AI assistants to accelerate development, explore solutions faster, and write better code. I believe AI isn't replacing developers; it's amplifying what we can achieve.

## 💡 Development Philosophy

```python
class AlessandroDev:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = ["Django", "React Native", "Selenium", "Claude AI", "Cursor"]
        self.principles = [
            "AI is a coding partner, not a replacement",
            "Error handling is not optional",
            "Performance matters: 32s → 500ms is the goal",
            "Mobile-first design, always",
            "Logs tell the story when things break"
        ]
    
    def build_solution(self, problem):
        if problem.is_repetitive():
            return self.automate(problem)
        elif problem.needs_ui():
            return self.build_webapp(problem)
        else:
            return self.pair_with_ai_and_iterate(problem)
```

## 💬 Philosophy

> *"AI doesn't replace developers — it amplifies what we can build. The best solutions come from humans asking the right questions and AI helping execute the vision."*

**My approach:**
- 🧠 **AI as a pair programmer:** Claude and Cursor are daily coding partners
- 🎯 **Problem-first, not tech-first:** Choose the right tool for the job
- 🛡️ **Reliability over speed:** A slow, reliable system beats a fast, broken one
- 📝 **Document while you build:** AI can write code, but context is human
- 🔧 **Code should work at 2 AM:** Write for debugging, not just deployment
- ☕ **Automation should work while you sip coffee** — the whole point!
